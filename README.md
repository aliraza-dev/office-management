# Office Management System

## What is this? 
This is a custom software solution to manage HR tasks for my small team. It is a web application built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features as I go along. 

## Motivation

I am the CTO and Co-founder of my start up, [NUMU](https://numuworld.com). I have been working for the past 5 years on this company and have managed to procure a small team of 15 people in Pakistan. The team includes developers, devOps, qa engineers and HR people and requires more management than I can handle.

As mentioned I have HR people who are responsible for managing the team. However, I wanted to scratch the software development itch and build a custom solution to manage the HR tasks.
